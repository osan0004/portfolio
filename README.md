# My Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio. I Created it in my Web dev II course from start to finish, and it was not a piece of cake. In it you will find some of my works and learn a bit about me. but here's a summary. I'm currenty studing Interactive Media Design and I'm skilled in areas such as HTML & CSS, Photography, Videography, UX & UI design along with their based softwares like VScode, Lightroom Adibe Photoshop, Premier Pro, Adobe XD & Figma. 

## Challenges
Amongst many of the challenges I faced, the most consistent wwas CSS, I find css to be really fun and interesting at times but other times it can be a pain. But with many practice demos, trial and error and ofcourse the help of stackoverflow W3Schools and the likes I've been able to learn a considerable amout. No dount I'll still run into some dead ends here and there but I'm sure I can overcome them.

## Lessones Learned
- Always add a semicolon at the end of every css. that was the most common mistake I made when I just started coding and It drove me crazy. 
- I've learnt the importants of including accessibilit features like ARIA roles Schema & Skip links and using REM's & EM's rather than PX in my code, as it can be of great help to those with accessibility needs.
